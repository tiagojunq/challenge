# Software Testing Challenge

Hello,

Welcome to our software testing challenge! This challenge aims to assess your skills in API and frontend testing using the Cypress tool.

## Challenge Description

You will be responsible for performing automated tests on a sample web application. The application consists of a frontend interface and a RESTful API.

### Tasks

1. **API Testing:**

   - You should write tests to ensure that the API is functioning as expected.

   - Verify that API responses are correct and that status codes are being handled properly.

2. **Frontend Testing:**
   - Using Cypress, write tests to verify the user interface's behavior.
   - Test common user flows, such as login, navigation between pages, form filling, and interaction with page elements.
   - Ensure that the application is responsive and works correctly on different devices.

## Technologies Used

- Testing Tool: Cypress
- Languages: JavaScript (for test scripts)

## Evaluation Criteria

- Test Coverage: We will assess the extent of the tests written, ensuring adequate coverage for both the API and frontend.
